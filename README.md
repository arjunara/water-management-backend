# Water Management

##Hello All,

The following steps describes my code approach:
1. imported express, fs, readline packages into geektrust.js file.
2.  It reads input code line by line which has test cases in input.txt file, by using readline and file system modules,
3. created both calculate_without_guest.js and calculate_with_guest.js files,
4. calculate_without_guest.js returns an object which has initial water quantity and initial amount, that is calculated from appartment type and given
  corporate: borewell ratio.
5. calculate_with_guest.js comprise inital + excess water quantity and inital amount + excess water bill and return same in console.
