## Hello All,
The following steps describes my code approach:
=> imported express, fs, readline packages into geektrust.js file.
=> It reads input code line by line which has test cases in input.txt file, by using readline and file system modules,
=> created both calculate_without_guest.js and calculate_with_guest.js files,
=> calculate_without_guest.js returns an object which has initial water quantity and initial amount, that is calculated from appartment type and given
  corporate: borewell ratio.
=> calculate_with_guest.js comprise inital + excess water quantity and inital amount + excess water bill and return same in console.
